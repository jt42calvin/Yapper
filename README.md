# YouTube Comedy Highlight Generator

*An AI-powered tool that analyzes YouTube videos to extract and create highlight reels of the funniest moments*

## Team Members
- Jacob Tocila
- Nick Roberts

## Project Overview

This project creates a "toy version" of an event/meeting summarizer, specifically focused on identifying and extracting the funniest moments from YouTube videos. Users can input a YouTube link and receive a trimmed highlight reel containing the most humorous parts of the content.

### Core Functionality
- Download YouTube videos and extract audio/transcripts
- Analyze transcripts using AI to identify funny moments
- Detect laughter and ambient audio cues for humor ranking
- Generate trimmed highlight videos of the funniest parts

## Use Case Scenario

**Primary User Story:**
> Two people are in a room, one wants to show a long funny video to their friend. Their friend doesn't have a lot of time and wants to see JUST the funniest part. This tool can be used to help quickly identify the funniest part and generate a short trimmed version of the long video for the busy friend.

## Technical Architecture

### Input Processing
- **Audio Input:** YouTube video URLs
- **Processing Pipeline:**
  - Download video content from YouTube
  - Generate .mp4, .mp3, and .txt files
  - Extract transcripts using speech-to-text APIs:
    - AssemblyAI (cloud-based speech-to-text API)
    - OpenAI Whisper API alternative
  - Analyze audio for laughter detection and intensity ranking

### Output Generation
- **Primary Output:** Trimmed highlight video clips
- **Secondary Output:** Text summaries of funny moments
- **Format Options:** Brief bullet points or full sentences depending on performance requirements

### Current Technology Stack
- Frontend web interface for YouTube URL input
- YouTube data extraction and processing
- Ollama for AI analysis of transcripts
- Audio processing libraries for laughter detection

## Key Design Decisions & Analysis

### Unique Design Choice
**Laughter-Based Humor Detection:** Unlike traditional text summarization systems, our approach incorporates:
- Audio analysis for laughter detection
- Ambient noise processing
- Intensity and duration ranking of laughter
- Multi-modal analysis combining text and audio cues

### Research Questions & Considerations

**Effectiveness & Accuracy:**
- How do we measure what constitutes a "good" funny summary?
- Does the AI actually identify genuinely funny moments?
- How does cultural context affect humor detection?

**Privacy & Ethics:**
- What are the implications of AI-driven content curation?
- Should AI decide what moments are "key" in our conversations?
- How do we handle different types of humor (visual vs. audio)?

**User Experience:**
- Will this tool enhance or replace human judgment in content consumption?
- How does efficiency impact the natural discovery of humor?
- What constitutes an optimal highlight length?

## Current Development Status

### Working Features
âœ… YouTube video downloading and processing  
âœ… Transcript generation from audio  
âœ… Basic AI analysis for humor detection  
âœ… File format conversion (.mp4, .mp3, .txt)  
âœ… Frontend interface for URL input  

### Known Limitations & Issues
- **Humor Detection Accuracy:** AI often selects setup portions rather than punchlines
  - Example: In John Mulaney content, AI identified opening setup as funniest rather than the actual punchline at the end
- **Cultural Context Limitations:** System may miss niche humor, memes, or culturally specific jokes
- **Bias Concerns:** May be influenced by laugh tracks in low-quality content
- **Limited Scope:** More effective with stand-up comedy format than visual or physical humor

### Systematic Biases & Vulnerabilities
- **Laugh Track Bias:** May incorrectly identify artificially enhanced moments as genuinely funny
- **Cultural Blind Spots:** Training data limitations affect understanding of contemporary humor, memes, and post-ironic content
- **Format Limitations:** Less effective with visual or physical comedy that relies on non-verbal cues
- **Temporal Understanding:** Difficulty distinguishing between setup and payoff in comedic timing

## Evaluation Metrics

### Quantitative Measures
- Accuracy of humor identification vs. human judgment
- User satisfaction with highlight selections
- Time efficiency compared to manual selection
- Consistency across different comedy formats

### User Testing Approach
- Small-scale testing with friends and volunteers
- Feedback collection on highlight quality and usefulness
- Iterative improvement based on user input
- A/B testing of different humor detection algorithms

## Development Roadmap

### Phase 1: Core Functionality (Current)
- âœ… Basic video processing pipeline
- âœ… Transcript generation
- ðŸ”„ Improving humor detection accuracy

### Phase 2: Enhanced Detection
- Audio analysis integration for laughter detection
- Multi-modal analysis combining text and audio
- Cultural context improvement

### Phase 3: User Experience
- Refined frontend interface
- In-browser video player for highlights
- User feedback integration system

### Phase 4: Testing & Iteration
- Comprehensive user testing
- Performance optimization
- Bias mitigation strategies

## Technical Implementation Notes

### API Integration
