What if we had a way to suggest our AI what the funniest part is? The AI just finds the part to trim

Maybe a textbox?: "I found the funniest part when Bob said "x""

G4: "The output video may not be what you find funny"

G5: Make sure AI does not suggest any racist/derogatory jokes

G6: Humor/comedy has it's own bias based on culture. 
    - Perhaps have settings users can tell the AI what their social norms are 
    - What kind of humor they like. (Light humor, average, dark humor)
    - Mini survey as settings UI?


Model Context Protocol (MCP):
    A standard way of AI using tools
    - Perhaps we can add a YouTube login feature to get context from already liked videos?
    - Can use Playwright to test the our website
